Peer Review by Zachary Dressel: 
  Home Page: Looks great at 1920, however width of page objects looks a little small, Looks a
  lot closer at 1440p. Spacing at mobile is great!
  
  About: I like the way that the images line up when reaching smaller screen sizes, however
  the image shrink looks a little odd on my screen (not bad)

  Menu: Spacing looks off, and the use of HR lines instead of border-bottom is what I think
  is causing the most issue. the lines fail to stay within the bounds of the divs when reaching
  smaller screen sizes, as well as the padding/margins on the text causes the screen to have
  a lot of empty space.

  Catering: On first glance at 1920 I notice that the center container image looks off, as 
  it has been stretched tall to match the text next to it. Causes a little bit of visual 
  confusion for me. The text shrinks well, but the images do not, I would reccomend setting
  them to dissapear after reaching a certain point.

  Photos: Everything shrinks down well and looks good!
